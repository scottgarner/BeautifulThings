## Making Things Beautiful / Making Beautiful Things

### Office Hours

I am holding office hours this semester (Spring 2014) for ITP students wishing to create beautiful things.

1. Appropriate topics for these sessions include the development of beautiful and meaningful concepts, the creation of beautiful and refined projects and the documentation of those projects in a beautiful and communicative way.

2. These sessions are part of my thesis research and will be treated to some extent as case studies. However, none of your personal information will be made public without your consent.

To sign up for office hours, please use [this form](scottgarner.youcanbook.me). The times will vary from week to week to give the broadest availability to the most students.
